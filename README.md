<h2>Hi there everyone</h2>
First of all you need to upload project from GitHub <br>
` git clone https://github.com/pshkravets/posts_api.git ` <br>
Then you need to find docker-compose file and go to thid directory
`cd <path_to_docker-compose>` <br>
Then you need to start container <br>
`docker-compose up` <br>
To send API requests you need your API key so just login
with random email and password.
You can see all API documentation by path: http://localhost:8000/api/docs <br>
So here we are! Have a beautiful day :)
